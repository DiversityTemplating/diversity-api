# diversity-api

An erlang diversity api that serves files and settings on the fly.

## Requirements

Diversity-api requires Erlang/OTP R17 which can be downloaded here:  
https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp

## Configuration

Before compiling you need to configure where the git repos should be cloned to and
what port to use for the api server. This is currently done in the `rel/sys.config` file:

- ``` repo_dir ``` Where all diversity components will be checked out to.
- ``` nodes ``` List of nodes where updates and registers will be called on. Empty list if no other nodes exists.
- ``` port ``` Which port the node will be listening to.

```Erlang
[{
    divapi,  [{repo_dir, "path/to/your/directory"},
              {nodes, []}
              {port, 8181}]
}].
```
### Note:
To configure or change configuration after building the release, the sys.config used by the release are located in
`_rel/divapi_release/releases/1/sys.config`.

## Building
`make` - Fetches dependencies, compiles and builds a release in _rel/divapi_release/

## Running
- `./_rel/divapi_release/bin/divapi_release start` - start the server
- `./_rel/divapi_release/bin/divapi_release stop`  - stop the server
- `./_rel/divapi_release/bin/divapi_release console`  - start the server with a console
